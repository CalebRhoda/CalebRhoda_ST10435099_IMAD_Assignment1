This is the Report of the Age Finder App written using Kotlin 26 on Android Studio.

I created this app in March 2024 for IMAD5112 for my first assignment using Android Studio. Android Studio utilises a lot of drag and drop features which helps speed up the creation of a visually appealing user interface. It takes some time to get used to which can put a lot of people off getting used to certain aspects of the workspace such as restraints and attributes. This can be easily rectified in the code section of the xml activity. At first I did struggle with the layout with the pictures and the restraining however after a couple of hours of experimenting it became a fluid process.
  
The user interface of the app looks like this. The title is at the top, followed by text which prompts the user to enter an age in the box adjacent to said text. The box clarifies the ages in which it accepts, that being numbers between 20 and 100. Below the input text box are the buttons ‘Generate’ and ‘Clear’. Generate runs the code and clear removes any text that you entered as well as clearing the output box. The output box is located within the bottom image.

This app is called App Finder which allows you to input your age, or any age and it will output a famous figure that died at that age. It uses if statements to check if the inputted age is valid and has an attached famous figure. It has a very simple user interface and is very easy to use. The background is that of a canyon and there is a picture of a treeline which is used to display the output. There is an input box where you can type in numbers, and it will display text depending on the condition. There is also a button to clear the input and output text boxes. To use the app simply input an age between 20 and 100 in the white text box, press the Generate button and read what the output box says. Use the clear button to input more numbers and to remove any leftover text in the output box.
As this is my first project in Android Studio there were a few errors in which I had to use Stack Overflow, YouTube and Chat to fix. The purpose of this app is to educate the user on historical figures and the age at which they died by showing a historical figure which died at their age. Currently there are only 10 historical figures stored in the code, which can be easily expanded upon in the historical figures string list. The assignment only required me to insert 10 historical figures so there isn’t a historical figure stored for every number between 20 and 100.
